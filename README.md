# Fractal-Simulation
A **container shape** is defined from a number of *n* points placed randomly.

An initial point *P* is created in a random position "Start"

The following procedure repeats for a number of 100,000 iterations:
1. A container shape point is randomly selected
2. *P* moves to the midpoint of the line connecting its current position and the selected container point.

## Usage
- Change the number of the container shape points (3-10) and observe changes in the fractal.
- Click Randomize to view other variances of the simulation under the same parameters.
- Change other parameters such as color, number of iterations etc in the file 

## Requirements
This app uses JQuery 3.6 and Bootstrap 5.0.1.
